## Guidelines for naming branches

Branches may be named like: `<identifier>-<description-with-hyphens>`

Identifiers represent the main goal of the branch, and might be:

- `feat` : New feature or feature expansion.
- `fix` : Bug fix.
- `docs` : Add or expand documentation.
- `style` : Code formating, without altering its content.
- `refactor` : Refactor (ex: change variable names, alter class structure).
- `perf` : Performance improvement.
- `test` : Add, expand or correct test.
- `example` : Add, expand or correct example.
- `wip` : Works in progress, that might not be done soon.
- `exp` : Exeriment, probably discarded.

Examples: `feat-roll-off`, `docs-shim-notebook`, `fix-shimming-results-plot-char`
